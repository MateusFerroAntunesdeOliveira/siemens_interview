<p align="center"><bold>SIEMENS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS! üöÄ</bold></p>

## Overview

The test for the interview consists of 10 questions about concepts and programming logic, as well as SQL

Regarding programming issues, all of them should be done following "clean code" standards and presenting clear resolutions.
Furthermore, the required language had to be C/C++ or Java.

The test was done in 2 days, where there was a lot of learning and effort to match the questions as best as possible.

The next step, if I pass this test, is a job interview at the German industrial conglomerate called Siemens. I hope everything works out
